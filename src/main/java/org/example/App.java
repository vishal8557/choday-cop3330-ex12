//Exercise 12 - Computing Simple Interest
        //Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly figure out whether an investment has value. Itâ€™s also a good way to get comfortable with explicitly coding the order of operations in your programs.

       // Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time, and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).

       // The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where P is the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest, t is the number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount at the end of the investment.

       // Example Output
       // Enter the principal: 1500
       // Enter the rate of interest: 4.3
       // Enter the number of years: 4
       // After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will be worth $1758.
       // Constraints
       // Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like 15, not .15). Divide the input by 100 in your program.
        //Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
       // Ensure that the output is formatted as money.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double amount_principal;
        double INTERESTRATE;
        int THE_YEARS;
        double the_amt_now_there;

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the principal: ");
        amount_principal = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter the rate of interest: ");
        INTERESTRATE = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter the number of years: ");
        THE_YEARS = input.nextInt();
        //formula
        the_amt_now_there = amount_principal * (1 + (INTERESTRATE / 100) * THE_YEARS);

        System.out.format("After %d years at %.2f%%, the investment will be worth $%d.", THE_YEARS, INTERESTRATE, Math.round(the_amt_now_there));

    }
